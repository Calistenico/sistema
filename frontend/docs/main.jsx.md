```javascript
import React from "react";
import ReactDOM from "react-dom/client";
import { BrowserRouter as Router } from "react-router-dom";
import App from "@/App.jsx";
import "@/index.css";
const isDev = process.env.NODE_ENV !== "production";
const REACTWRAP = isDev ? React.Fragment : React.StrictMode;

ReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementById("root")).render(
  <REACTWRAP>
    <Router>
      <App />
    </Router>
  </REACTWRAP>
);

```
**Purpose and Usage**

The provided code snippet initializes a React application using the `ReactDOM` library. The purpose of this code is to render an React application on the client-side (in the browser) using the `createRoot` method.

The intended usage of this code is to set up a basic React application structure, allowing developers to build upon it with additional components, routes, and features.

**Method Documentation**

* `ReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementById("root")).render(...)`
	+ Purpose: Initializes a new React root and renders the provided JSX element(s) into the DOM.
	+ Parameters:
		- `document.getElementById("root")`: The root HTML element to render the application into. In this case, it's an element with the ID "root".
		- `(...)`: The JSX elements or components to be rendered.
	+ Return Value: None (void)
* `const REACTWRAP = isDev ? React.Fragment : React.StrictMode;`
	+ Purpose: Defines a reusable React wrapper component based on whether the application is running in development mode (`isDev`) or production mode.
	+ Parameters:
		- `isDev`: A boolean indicating whether the application is running in development mode.
* `const isDev = process.env.NODE_ENV !== "production";`
	+ Purpose: Determines whether the application is running in development mode based on the value of the `NODE_ENV` environment variable.

**Examples**

Here's an example of how to use this code snippet:
```javascript
import React from 'react';
import ReactDOM from 'react-dom/client';

const App = () => {
  return <h1>Hello, World!</h1>;
};

ReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementById('root')).render(
  <REACTWRAP>
    <Router>
      <App />
    </Router>
  </REACTWRAP>
);
```
This code sets up a basic React application that renders an `<h1>` element with the text "Hello, World!".
