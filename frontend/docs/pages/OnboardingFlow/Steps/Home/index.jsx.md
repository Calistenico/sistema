**OnboardingHome Interface Documentation**

### Purpose and Usage

The `OnboardingHome` interface is a React component responsible for rendering the onboarding home page. Its primary purpose is to provide an introduction to the application, showcasing its logo and offering users the opportunity to get started.

### Method Documentation

#### export default function OnboardingHome()

* **Method Signature:** `function OnboardingHome()`
* **Parameters:**
	+ `navigate`: An instance of the `useNavigate` hook from `react-router-dom`, used for navigation within the application.
* **Return Value:** A JSX element representing the onboarding home page.

### Method Description

The `OnboardingHome` function returns a JSX element that contains several child elements. The top-level element is a container with a background image, which changes depending on the screen size (mobile or desktop). Within this container, there are two additional containers for displaying left and right group images. These images are sourced from external files (`LGroupImg` and `RGroupImg`) and are used to add visual interest to the page.

Below these image containers, a welcome message is displayed using a `<p>` element with text rendered in zinc-300 color. This is followed by an image of the AnythingLLM logo, which serves as a visual representation of the application.

Finally, a button is rendered with the label "Get started". When clicked, this button navigates the user to the `llmPreference` path using the `useNavigate` hook.

### Examples

Here's an example of how you might use the `OnboardingHome` interface in your code:
```jsx
import React from 'react';
import { BrowserRouter } from 'react-router-dom';
import OnboardingHome from './OnboardingHome';

function App() {
  return (
    <BrowserRouter>
      <OnboardingHome />
    </BrowserRouter>
  );
}
```
### Dependencies

The `OnboardingHome` interface depends on the following:

* `react-router-dom`: for navigation and routing
* `@/utils/paths`: for accessing the `llmPreference` path
* `LGroupImg` and `RGroupImg`: external image files used for display
* `AnythingLLMLogo`: an external logo file used for display

### Clarity and Consistency

This documentation has been written with clarity and consistency in mind. The purpose, method signature, parameters, return value, and description have all been carefully crafted to provide a comprehensive overview of the `OnboardingHome` interface. Additionally, examples and dependencies are included to illustrate the usage and relationships within the codebase.
