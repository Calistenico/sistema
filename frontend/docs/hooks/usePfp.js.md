```javascript
import { useContext } from "react";
import { PfpContext } from "../PfpContext";

export default function usePfp() {
  const { pfp, setPfp } = useContext(PfpContext);
  return { pfp, setPfp };
}

```
**usePfp**
================

**Purpose and Usage:**

The `usePfp` hook is a custom React hook that provides access to the profile picture (PFP) context and its associated functions. This hook is intended for use within components that require interaction with the PFP state.

**Method Documentation:**

### useContext(PfpContext)

**Signature:** `const { pfp, setPfp } = useContext(PfpContext);`

**Purpose:** Retrieves the current profile picture (PFP) and its associated setter function from the PFP context.

**Parameters:**

* None

**Return Value:** An object containing the current PFP (`pfp`) and a function to update the PFP (`setPfp`).

### Examples:

Here's an example of how you can use the `usePfp` hook within a component:
```jsx
import React from 'react';
import usePfp from './usePfp';

function MyComponent() {
  const { pfp, setPfp } = usePfp();

  return (
    <div>
      {/* Use the PFP */}
      <img src={pfp} alt="Profile Picture" />
      <button onClick={() => setPfp(newPfpUrl)}>Update Profile Picture</button>
    </div>
  );
}
```
In this example, we use the `usePfp` hook to retrieve the current PFP and its associated setter function. We then display the PFP and provide a button to update it.

**Dependencies:**

The `usePfp` hook relies on the `PfpContext` context provided by another part of the codebase. This context is used to manage the state of profile pictures throughout the application.
