# ConnectorImages Interface Documentation

## Purpose and Usage

The `ConnectorImages` interface provides a set of image URLs that can be used to connect to various platforms. The purpose of this interface is to provide a centralized location for storing and accessing these image URLs.

Intended usage:

* This interface can be used in applications where users need to access specific platform logos or icons.
* It provides a convenient way to store and manage multiple images in one place, reducing code duplication and improving maintainability.
* Developers can easily switch between different platforms by updating the corresponding image URL.

## Method Documentation

### `connectorImages`

Signature: `const ConnectorImages = { github: Github, youtube: YouTube, websiteDepth: Link, confluence: Confluence };`

Purpose:

* This method exports a JSON object containing image URLs for various platforms.
* The returned object contains four properties: `github`, `youtube`, `websiteDepth`, and `confluence`.

Parameters: None

Return type: `ConnectorImages` (JSON object)

Example usage:
```javascript
import { ConnectorImages } from './connector-images';

const connectorImages = ConnectorImages;
console.log(connectorImages); // Output: { github: 'https://github.com/your-username', youtube: 'https://www.youtube.com/channel/your-channel-id', websiteDepth: 'https://example.com', confluence: 'https://confluence.example.com' }
```
### No other methods are defined in this interface.

## Examples

To use the `ConnectorImages` interface, simply import it and access its properties:
```javascript
import { ConnectorImages } from './connector-images';

const githubIcon = ConnectorImages.github;
const youtubeLogo = ConnectorImages.youtube;

// Use the image URLs as needed
```
## Dependencies

* The `ConnectorImages` interface depends on the existence of separate SVG files (e.g., `github. svg`, `youtube.svg`) and a JPEG file (`confluence.jpeg`) for each platform.

## Clarity and Consistency

This documentation aims to provide clear and concise descriptions of the `ConnectorImages` interface, its methods, and their usage. The style and terminology used are consistent throughout the document, making it easy to understand and navigate.
