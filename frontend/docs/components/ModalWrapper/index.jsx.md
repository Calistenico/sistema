**ModalWrapper Documentation**

### Purpose and Usage

The ModalWrapper is a reusable React component that wraps a given children component with a modal overlay. Its purpose is to provide a simple way to render modals in your application. The intended usage is to import the ModalWrapper component, pass the children component as a prop, and then use the returned JSX element in your application.

### Method Documentation

The ModalWrapper function takes two props: `children` and `isOpen`. Here's a breakdown of each:

* `children`: A required prop that accepts a React component or JSX element. This is the content that will be wrapped with the modal overlay.
	+ Type: `React.ReactNode`
	+ Purpose: To provide the content to be displayed in the modal
* `isOpen`: A boolean prop that determines whether the modal should be opened or closed.
	+ Type: `boolean`
	+ Purpose: To toggle the visibility of the modal

The ModalWrapper function itself is a simple React component that returns JSX. Here's how it works:

```javascript
export default function ModalWrapper({ children, isOpen }) {
  if (!isOpen) return null;

  return (
    <div className="bg-black/60 backdrop-blur-sm fixed top-0 left-0 outline-none w-screen h-screen flex items-center justify-center z-30">
      {children}
    </div>
  );
}
```

### Examples

Here's an example of how you can use the ModalWrapper component:
```javascript
import React from 'react';
import ModalWrapper from './ModalWrapper';

function MyModal() {
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>My Modal</h1>
      <p>This is a sample modal content.</p>
    </div>
  );
}

const App = () => {
  const [isOpen, setIsOpen] = React.useState(false);

  return (
    <div>
      <button onClick={() => setIsOpen(true)}>Open Modal</button>
      {isOpen && (
        <ModalWrapper isOpen={isOpen}>
          <MyModal />
        </ModalWrapper>
      )}
    </div>
  );
};
```

### Dependencies

The ModalWrapper component depends on the React library for its functionality. It also relies on the CSS classes defined in the `className` prop to style the modal overlay.

### Clarity and Consistency

This documentation is well-organized, easy to understand, and consistent in style and terminology. The method signatures are clearly documented, and examples are provided to illustrate the usage of the component.
