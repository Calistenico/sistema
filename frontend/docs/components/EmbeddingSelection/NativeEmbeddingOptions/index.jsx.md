# NativeEmbeddingOptions Documentation

## Purpose and Usage

The `NativeEmbeddingOptions` interface is designed to provide a straightforward way to use AnythingLLM's native embedding engine. With this interface, you can easily integrate the engine into your codebase without requiring any setup.

This interface returns an HTML element that displays information about the native embedding engine. The returned element includes a paragraph of text that explains there is no setup required when using the engine.

## Method Documentation

The `NativeEmbeddingOptions` interface contains one method:

### `return`

* Signature: `() => JSX.Element`
* Purpose: Returns an HTML element representing the native embedding options.
* Parameters: None
* Return Type: A JSX element (an HTML element or a React component)
* Description: This method returns a `<div>` element with a paragraph of text that explains the usage of the native embedding engine.

### Example Usage

Here's an example of how you can use this interface:
```javascript
import NativeEmbeddingOptions from './NativeEmbeddingOptions';

const App = () => {
  const options = NativeEmbeddingOptions();
  return (
    <div>
      {options}
    </div>
  );
};
```
In this example, the `NativeEmbeddingOptions` interface is imported and used to get an HTML element that displays information about the native embedding engine. This element is then rendered in a React component.

## Dependencies

The `NativeEmbeddingOptions` interface depends on:

* AnythingLLM's native embedding engine: This is the underlying technology that provides the native embedding capabilities.
* JSX or React: The returned HTML element can be used as-is with JSX, or you can wrap it with a React component if needed.
