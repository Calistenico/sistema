Based on the provided TypeScript code, I will generate comprehensive documentation in Markdown format.

**Purpose and Usage:**
The `FolderSelectionPopup` is a reusable React component used to select folders from a given list. Its primary purpose is to provide an intuitive user interface for selecting folders. This component can be integrated into various parts of your application where folder selection is necessary.

**Method Documentation:**

### export default function FolderSelectionPopup({ folders, onSelect, onClose })

* **Purpose:** Initializes the `FolderSelectionPopup` with a list of folders (`folders`), an event handler for folder selection (`onSelect`), and a callback to close the popup (`onClose`).
* **Signature:** `export default function FolderSelectionPopup({ folders: Array<Folder>, onSelect: (folder: Folder) => void, onClose: () => void })`
* **Parameters:**
	+ `folders`: An array of folder objects. Each object should contain a `name` property.
	+ `onSelect`: A callback function that will be called when a folder is selected. It takes a `folder` object as an argument and returns `void`.
	+ `onClose`: A callback function that will be called when the popup is closed. It returns `void`.

### const handleFolderSelect = (folder) => {}

* **Purpose:** Handles the selection of a folder.
* **Signature:** `(folder: Folder) => void`
* **Description:** This function is called when a folder is selected. It calls the `onSelect` callback with the selected folder as an argument and then closes the popup by calling the `onClose` callback.

**Examples:**

To use the `FolderSelectionPopup`, you need to import it and pass the necessary props:
```jsx
import FolderSelectionPopup from './FolderSelectionPopup';

const folders = [
  { name: 'Folder 1' },
  { name: 'Folder 2' },
  { name: 'Folder 3' },
];

const onSelect = (folder) => {
  // Handle folder selection here
};

const onClose = () => {
  // Close the popup here
};

const FolderSelectionPopupExample = () => (
  <div>
    <FolderSelectionPopup folders={folders} onSelect={onSelect} onClose={onClose} />
  </div>
);
```
**Dependencies:**

The `FolderSelectionPopup` depends on the `middleTruncate` function from the `@/utils/directories` module, which is used to truncate folder names for display purposes.

**Clarity and Consistency:**
This documentation aims to provide a clear and concise understanding of the `FolderSelectionPopup` component. The terminology and style are consistent throughout the documentation.
