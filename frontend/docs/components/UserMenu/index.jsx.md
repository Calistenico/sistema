**UserMenu Documentation**

**Purpose and Usage:**
The `UserMenu` interface provides a reusable component for displaying user information. Its primary purpose is to render a menu with user-specific data, allowing developers to easily integrate user-related features into their applications.

**Method Documentation:**

### `UserMenu({ children })`

#### Method Signature:
```
function UserMenu({ children }: { children: React.ReactNode }) => JSX.Element
```
#### Purpose:
The `UserMenu` function returns a JSX element that renders a menu with user-specific data. The `children` prop is used to pass child components or elements that will be rendered within the menu.

#### Parameters:

* `children`: A required prop that accepts React nodes (e.g., components, strings, numbers) that will be rendered within the menu.

#### Return Value:
The method returns a JSX element representing the user menu.

### Example Usage:
```jsx
import UserMenu from './UserMenu';
import UserButton from './UserButton';

function MyComponent() {
  return (
    <div>
      <UserMenu>
        <UserButton />
        <p>This is some additional content.</p>
      </UserMenu>
    </div>
  );
}
```
In this example, the `UserMenu` component is used to render a menu with a `UserButton` and some additional text. The `children` prop is passed an array of React nodes, which are then rendered within the menu.

**Dependencies:**

* `UserButton`: A dependency on the `UserButton` component is required for rendering user-specific data.
